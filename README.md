# Inkhaven (blackInkhaven)

**Inkhaven** is a standalone terminal application for writing books and
long-form technical documentation. It pairs a full-screen Typst editor with
a local semantic index, an AI writing assistant, versioned snapshots, and a
backup pipeline — so the entire writing workflow lives inside one binary,
without leaving the terminal.

Your manuscript is organised as a hierarchy of `.typ` files
(Book → Chapter → Subchapter → Paragraph), with first-class
**image** (`.png` / `.jpg` / …), **HJSON data** (`.hjson`), and
**Bund script** (`.bund`) leaves alongside paragraphs. Inkhaven
stores metadata in a local DuckDB database, indexes every text
node for full-text and semantic search, keeps versioned
snapshots, embeds the [Bund](Documentation/Bund/README.md)
scripting language for hooks + custom rules, and streams answers
from your chosen LLM provider — six are bundled (**Gemini**,
**Claude**, **OpenAI**, **DeepSeek**, **Grok**, **Ollama**) and any
model [genai](https://github.com/jeremychone/rust-genai) routes is
one HJSON line away.

## Latest release · 1.2.12 — Fullscreen split view, translation workflow, polish

Read the full notes: [`Documentation/RELEASE_NOTES/1.2.12.md`](Documentation/RELEASE_NOTES/1.2.12.md)

1.2.12's headline is a four-phase rework of how
inkhaven handles two-paragraph workflows — the
long-deferred fullscreen split view feature.
Plus a clutch of carryover polish: concordance
export, HJSON-editor LLM review, per-detector
underline modifiers, snapshot side-by-side.

### Fullscreen split view — `Shift+F4`

`Shift+F4` toggles a three-column layout: tree
pane on the left, primary editor in the middle,
secondary editor on the right.  AI response pane
hides (the two editors need the room); AI prompt
input still spans the bottom so `Ctrl+I` works
from either pane.  `Tab` swaps focus between the
two editors.

**Universal `Shift+Enter` pin modifier.**  Every
paragraph picker that targets the primary slot
now also accepts `Shift+Enter` as a "pin to the
right pane instead" modifier.  Same picker, same
filter, same selection — the modifier changes the
destination.  Works from:

- Tree-pane Enter
- `Ctrl+V P` (fuzzy paragraph picker)
- `Ctrl+V Shift+P` (recent paragraphs)
- `Ctrl+V M` (bookmarks)
- `F6` snapshot picker (pins as read-only
  historical view)

**Sibling-book lookup — `Ctrl+V Shift+B`.**  The
translation-workflow chord.  Given the open
paragraph's slug, walks the project's hierarchy
for paragraphs with the same slug under a
*different* top-level book.  Single match →
auto-pin.  Multi-match → fuzzy picker scoped to
the matches.  Designed for parallel manuscripts:
from `manuscript-en/chapter-3/03-rain`, finds
`manuscript-ru/chapter-3/03-rain` and pins it.

**F12 `critique-compare`.**  When the split is on
AND both panes hold distinct paragraphs, F12
fires the new `critique-compare` embedded prompt
— eighth named flow, five-language match
(en / ru / es / de / fr) routed through the
1.2.11 multilingual resolver.  The model
compares the two paragraphs substantively: what
overlaps, what diverges, which one lands the
beat harder.  Specifically covers translation
review (source vs translation: does it carry
meaning, voice, register?) and draft comparison
(snapshot vs current: which is stronger?).

The `Documentation/PROPOSALS/SPLIT_VIEW.md`
proposal captures the four-phase design.

### Polish across the board

- **`inkhaven export-concordance` CLI.**  Same
  data the `Ctrl+B Shift+L` modal shows, written
  to disk for use in spreadsheets / analysis
  pipelines.  CSV (one row per stem) and JSON
  (structured form with KWIC snippets, line
  numbers) formats; `--min-count` flag drops the
  long tail.
- **`Ctrl+R` LLM review inside the `Ctrl+B 0`
  HJSON editor.**  Mirrors the 1.2.10
  prompts-editor TUI's reviewer-LLM pattern: the
  model critiques the project config as a piece
  of work, not by executing it.  Asks for
  dotted-path-specific critique (e.g.
  `editor.style_warnings.show_dont_tell.enabled`,
  not "the SDT field").  Use as a "second
  opinion" before saving a config change.
- **Per-detector underline-style overrides.**
  Three new HJSON theme knobs
  (`style_warning_*_modifier`) let users dial the
  filter-word / repeated-phrase / show-don't-tell
  overlay's modifier from the hardcoded `UNDERLINED`
  to `bold` / `dim` / `reversed` / `italic` /
  `none` / `+`-combined.  Empty preserves the
  baseline.  Useful on terminal palettes where
  the teal underline reads faint.
- **Build-time doc-comment extractor polish.**
  `Option<HashMap<K, V>>`, `Box<T>`, `Arc<T>`,
  `Rc<T>` wrappers all descend cleanly now;
  nested-map shapes preserve the `is_map` flag
  through every recursion level.

Plus a new tutorial
([`48-split-view.md`](Documentation/Tutorials/48-split-view.md));
the refreshed
[`INKHAVEN_CHEAT_SHEET.typ`](Documentation/INKHAVEN_CHEAT_SHEET.typ)
bumps from 1.2.6 to 1.2.12 with every chord added
since.

Every prior release lives under
[`Documentation/RELEASE_NOTES/`](Documentation/RELEASE_NOTES/).

## Why Inkhaven

- **Terminal-first.** Inkhaven runs over SSH, in tmux, on a tiling WM — no
  browser, no Electron. The TUI uses [ratatui](https://ratatui.rs/) and
  [tui-textarea](https://github.com/rhysd/tui-textarea).
- **Your manuscript is plain files.** A paragraph lives in a `.typ` file
  on disk; the metadata database tracks hierarchy and search but the prose
  is text — you can read it, diff it, version-control it, and edit it with
  another tool any time.
- **Semantic search out of the box.** Embeddings via fastembed and HNSW are
  computed locally. Search for *"the moment the lighthouse fails"* and find
  the paragraph even if it never uses those exact words.
- **AI is a co-author you steer.** Inferences stream live; you control the
  **scope** (selection / paragraph / subchapter / chapter / book), the
  **mode** (Local-only RAG vs. Full general knowledge), and the
  **destination** (replace, insert, top, bottom, copy, grammar-apply).
  Inkhaven does NOT provide inherent privacy when external providers
  (Gemini / Claude / OpenAI / DeepSeek / Grok) are used — prompts
  travel to their servers under their terms. For privacy, set
  `llm.default_provider: "ollama"` and run a local model; every other
  inkhaven subsystem (RAG embedding, semantic search, snapshot diff)
  is already on-device.
- **Multilingual.** Snowball stemmers and multilingual embeddings make
  Russian, German, French, Spanish, Italian and others first-class. The
  shipped defaults cover English and Russian.
- **Help, characters, places, artefacts, scripts — built in.** Nine
  system books are seeded on every project: `Notes`, `Research`,
  `Prompts`, `Places`, `Characters`, `Artefacts`, `Typst`, `Scripts`,
  `Help`. Mentions of names from the lexicon books light up in the
  editor (cyan / amber / peach / underline). `Ctrl+B P` / `C` / `Y` /
  `G` query each via RAG. `F1` answers questions about Inkhaven itself
  by RAG over `Help`. `Scripts` (added in 1.2) holds `.bund` source
  files auto-loaded into the embedded Bund scripting VM at project
  open — see [`Documentation/Bund/`](Documentation/Bund/README.md).
- **First-class images.** Drop PNG / JPG / WebP / SVG into the tree;
  Book assembly emits the right `wrap_image_*` calls and ships the
  bytes into the typst tree. `Ctrl+B P` inside `#image("…")` opens a
  sibling picker. Enter on an Image row pops a ratatui-image preview
  (kitty / sixel / iterm2 / half-block).
- **From buffer to PDF in two chords.** `Ctrl+B A` assembles your tree
  into a typst-compilable directory; `Ctrl+B B` compiles it; `Ctrl+B O`
  builds and copies the PDF into your shell's cwd as
  `<book>-YYYYDDMM-HHMM.pdf`. Compile failures route the captured
  stderr into a fresh AI chat with a typst-aware system prompt.

## Features at a glance

### Editor
- Typst syntax highlighting via [tree-sitter-typst](https://github.com/uben0/tree-sitter-typst).
- Regex find / replace with same-line current-match highlighting.
- Split-edit with versioned snapshots — see two versions of a paragraph
  side by side, accept either.
- Word-aware navigation and deletion shortcuts.
- Vertical block selection (Alt+arrows) with rectangular copy.
- System-clipboard cut / copy / paste, plus per-doc undo / redo.
- Live "changes since last save" bolding; grammar-correction highlights
  what changed after a `g` apply.

### Tree
- Multi-level folding (`←` / `→` / `Z` / `X`).
- Per-kind row colours (book / chapter / subchapter / paragraph / image)
  + open-paragraph marker.
- Plain-letter shortcuts for add (`B`/`C`/`V`/`A`/`S`/`+`/`P`),
  delete (`D`/`-`), reorder (`U`/`J`).
- **Document status badge** column — one character per row colour-
  coded to the workflow stage (`n` / `1` / `2` / `3` / `F` / `R`).
- Mouse: click to focus + select; scroll wheel scrolls.

### AI pane
- Streaming markdown rendering — bold / italic / headings / code / lists.
- Six **scope modes** (cycled by `F9`): None, Selection, Paragraph,
  Subchapter, Chapter, Book — each prepends the matching content to the
  next prompt.
- Two **inference modes** (`F10`): **Local** (use only supplied context)
  and **Full** (augment with general knowledge). Help inferences are pinned
  to Local automatically.
- Persistent **chat history** with one-key clear (`Ctrl+B C`).
- **Full-screen AI layout** (`Ctrl+B K`) — AI pane + scrollable chat
  history + AI prompt; persisted to `.inkhaven-chat.json` between
  sessions; `Ctrl+F` searches; `Ctrl+C` enters a turn-selection mode.
- **Lexicon RAG** — `Ctrl+B P` / `C` / `G` / `Y` in the editor sweep
  the selection through `Places` / `Characters` / `Notes` / `Artefacts`
  and prepend the lookup to the next AI prompt.
- **F1 Help-manual** floating query → grounded answer over the Help book.
  `inkhaven import-typst-help` seeds Help with a curated typst reference.
- **F7 Grammar check** with deterministic correction extraction (`g`
  replaces the buffer with just the corrected text, preserving Typst
  markup).

### Storage and backup
- DuckDB metadata + Tantivy full-text + HNSW vectors via
  [bdslib](https://github.com/vulogov/bdslib).
- Snapshots: `F5` captures the buffer; `F6` opens the snapshot history
  picker.
- `inkhaven backup --out <dir>` zips the entire project.
- `inkhaven restore <archive> --to <dir>` puts it back.
- Auto-backup on TUI exit when the last backup is older than
  `backup.max_age` (humantime: `7d`, `12h`, `30m`, …) — splash screen with
  a progress bar.
- Session persistence: cursor position, focus, tree-scroll, open paragraph
  all survive restarts. Per-paragraph cursor memory: switch around and
  every paragraph remembers where you were.

### CLI tools
- `init` — set up a fresh project (interactive confirmation if the
  directory exists).
- `add` / `delete` / `mv` / `list` — manage the hierarchy from a script.
- `search "phrase"` — semantic search from the shell.
- `reindex` — re-walk `.typ` files into the database.
- `export typst` / `export pdf` — produce a single Typst manuscript or a
  built PDF.
- `import-help --documents-directory <dir>` — populate the Help book from
  a directory of markdown / text / typst files (wipes Help first).
- `backup` / `restore` — see above.
- `ai "prompt"` — one-shot inference from the shell (no TUI).

### Configuration
A single `inkhaven.hjson` in each project root drives every knob:
embedding model, LLM providers, autosave cadence, sync interval, hierarchy
depth, language, snowball stemmers, the full visual theme (per-pane
backgrounds and foregrounds, all syntax colours, lexicon highlight
colours), key bindings, and backup policy.

## Install

Inkhaven ships as a single static binary per platform. Three install paths:

### 1. `cargo binstall` (no compile)

If you already have [`cargo-binstall`](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall):

```bash
cargo binstall inkhaven
```

`cargo-binstall` reads `[package.metadata.binstall]` from `Cargo.toml`,
picks the right asset off GitHub Releases, and drops the binary into
`~/.cargo/bin`. Works on Linux (x86_64), macOS (Intel + Apple Silicon),
and Windows (x86_64).

### 2. GitHub Releases (direct download)

Grab the tarball for your platform from
[Releases](https://github.com/vulogov/blackInkhaven/releases), unpack,
and put `inkhaven` somewhere on your `PATH`. Builds are produced by
the [`release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml) workflow on every
tag push.

### 3. `cargo install --git` (compile from source)

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/vulogov/blackInkhaven --tag v1.0.0
```

This works because every dependency (including `bdslib` and
`tree-sitter-typst`) is vendored under `vendor/` — no separate registry
fetches, no GitHub auth needed. The first build takes ~10 minutes on a
modern laptop because of DuckDB + Tantivy + fastembed compilation; the
release binary above is the fast path.

> Inkhaven is **not** published on crates.io. See `Cargo.toml`'s
> `publish = false` line and the [`Documentation/`](Documentation/)
> notes for the rationale.

## Quick start

```bash
# Build (if installing from source)
cargo build --release

# Initialise a project (asks for confirmation if the directory exists)
./target/release/inkhaven init ~/Books/my-novel

# Build the hierarchy from the CLI…
./target/release/inkhaven --project ~/Books/my-novel add book "My Novel"
./target/release/inkhaven --project ~/Books/my-novel \
    add chapter "The Beginning" --parent my-novel
./target/release/inkhaven --project ~/Books/my-novel \
    add paragraph "Opening Scene" --parent my-novel/the-beginning

# …or skip the CLI and add everything from the TUI
./target/release/inkhaven --project ~/Books/my-novel
# Inside the TUI: B (book), C/V (chapter), A/S (subchapter), +/P (paragraph)
```

## Use cases

- **Long-form fiction.** Hierarchy fits novels naturally (Book → Part →
  Chapter → Scene). Places / Characters / Research system books keep
  worldbuilding next to prose.
- **Technical documentation.** Each chapter is a `.typ` file; the tree
  doubles as a table of contents. Semantic search makes "where did I
  document the retry policy?" a one-keystroke question.
- **Translation work.** Multilingual embeddings + per-language Snowball
  stemmers let you keep source and target in two parallel books.
- **Research notebooks.** Snapshots track how a draft evolved; the AI pane
  can summarise a chapter when you come back after a week.
- **Help and onboarding writing.** Ship docs as a directory and let
  Inkhaven build a Help book your readers can query through F1.
