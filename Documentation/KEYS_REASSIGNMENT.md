# Reassigning chord keys

Inkhaven's chord layout (`Ctrl+B C` adds a chapter, `Ctrl+B M`
cycles a node's type, …) is data-driven. You can rewrite any
sub-chord under the meta- or bund-prefix through two channels:

1. **HJSON** — `inkhaven.hjson` → `keys.bindings`. Static; applied
   at startup; survives restarts. The recommended path.
2. **Bund** — `ink.key.*` stdlib words. Dynamic; runs from a Script
   node or the bootstrap; sandboxed (default-denied). Useful for
   tools that conditionally remap based on project state.

Both channels mutate the same binding table the TUI dispatcher
reads on every key press, so a chord you bind from Bund is live
the next time you press it.

## What's rebindable, and what isn't

| Slot | How to change |
|------|---------------|
| Top-level chords (`Ctrl+S` save, `Ctrl+/` search, `Ctrl+I` ai_prompt, `Tab` next-pane, `Shift+Tab` prev-pane, `PgUp`/`PgDn`, `Ctrl+B` meta-prefix, `Ctrl+Z` bund-prefix) | `inkhaven.hjson` → individual `keys.*` fields |
| **Meta** sub-chords (everything after `Ctrl+B`) | `keys.bindings` in HJSON OR `ink.key.bind` |
| **Bund** sub-chords (everything after `Ctrl+Z`) | same |
| Hard-quit `Ctrl+Q` | **not rebindable** — intercepted before the chord dispatcher |
| F-keys (F1/F3/F5/F6/F7/F9/F10) | **not yet** — currently hardcoded; data-driven migration is a planned follow-up |

## Channel 1 — HJSON `keys.bindings`

```hjson
keys: {
  meta_prefix: "Ctrl+b"
  bund_prefix: "Ctrl+z"
  view_prefix: "Ctrl+v"     // 1.2.4+

  bindings: [
    // Re-letter: Ctrl+B Y also cycles type
    { chord: "Ctrl+b y", action: "tree.morph_type" }

    // Disable: Ctrl+B W no longer toggles typewriter mode
    { chord: "Ctrl+b w", action: "none" }

    // Pane-scoped: Ctrl+B X is "save" but ONLY in the editor pane
    { chord: "Ctrl+b x", action: "editor.save", scope: "editor" }

    // Add a bund sub-chord
    { chord: "Ctrl+z m", action: "bund.run_buffer" }

    // 1.2.4+: view sub-chord (Ctrl+V prefix)
    { chord: "Ctrl+v X", action: "view.fuzzy_paragraph_picker" }

    // 1.2.4+: rebind a top-level F-key
    { chord: "F7", action: "view.add_link" }
  ]
}
```

Each entry is `{ chord, action, scope? }`:

- **`chord`** — `"<prefix> <suffix>"` for meta / bund / view
  sub-chords (two whitespace-separated tokens; the prefix must
  match `meta_prefix`, `bund_prefix`, or `view_prefix`). For
  top-level keys (F-keys, 1.2.4+) use a single token: `"F7"`.
- **`action`** — dotted name from the [action table](#action-table).
  Use `"none"` to disable a default chord.
- **`scope`** — `"any"` (default) / `"editor"` / `"tree"` / `"ai"`.
  Narrow scopes beat broad ones when both match the focus.

Resolution order when multiple entries match a chord: most-recently-
added wins. Overlay entries are prepended to the table, so they
beat the built-in defaults; later overlay entries beat earlier
ones.

## Channel 2 — Bund `ink.key.*`

```bund
// Bind a chord to a built-in action by name
"Ctrl+b y" "tree.morph_type" ink.key.bind

// Bind a chord to an inline lambda — gets a synthetic name and
// runs via the same hooks::fire pathway as save hooks
"Ctrl+b j" { "jot!" println } ink.key.bind_lambda

// Drop a chord
"Ctrl+b y" ink.key.unbind

// JSON dump of every active binding
ink.key.list
```

All four `ink.key.*` words live in the `keymap` policy category,
which is in the default-deny set. Opt in:

```hjson
scripting: {
  enabled_categories: ["keymap"]
}
```

Then put your `ink.key.*` calls in `scripting.bootstrap` or a
`.bund` Script node — both run at project open after the policy
has been applied.

## Action table

Every reachable handler appears here exactly once. The "Default
chord" column shows the out-of-the-box meta-sub or bund-sub
chord that fires the action; the chord after `Ctrl+B` / `Ctrl+Z`
is what you type, not what the table key is.

| `view.story_graph` | `Ctrl+V W` | (1.2.5) Story view — twopi radial graph of the current book (hierarchy + wiki-links + lexicon mentions), rasterised via `resvg`. S saves the PNG. |

### Top-level keys (1.2.4+)

Layer name: `top_level`. F-keys migrated from hardcoded
matches into the bindings table — overlays accept single-token
chords (`f7`, `shift+f5`, …).

| Action | Default chord | Effect |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| `help_query` | `F1` | RAG over the Help book |

| `cycle_ai_mode` | `F9` | Cycle AI scope (Selection / Paragraph / Chapter / Book) |
| `toggle_inference_mode` | `F10` | Toggle inference mode (one-shot / chat) |

### Special

| Action | Default chord | Effect |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| `none` | *(no chord)* | "Do nothing" target — use in overlay to disable a default |

## Notes on the action table

- **Scope discrimination**: several letters mean different things in
  different panes. `Ctrl+B P` is `tree.add_paragraph` in the Tree
  pane but `editor.lookup_places_or_image` in the Editor pane. The
  binding entries carry `scope` so the dispatcher picks the right
  one based on focus.
- **Default-chord conflicts**: `B` is `global.schedule_build` AND
  the plain (non-meta) shortcut for "add book" in the Tree pane.
  The latter is handled outside the meta machinery, so the meta
  table only carries `schedule_build`.
- **Pane-agnostic chords** (`V`, `I`, `L`, `E`, `A`, `B`, `O`, `W`,
  `K`, `H`, status digits) live in the `Any` scope so they fire
  from every pane.

## Discovering bindings at runtime

- The **status bar** updates the moment you press the meta- or bund-
  prefix. It's now auto-generated from the live binding table, so
  any HJSON or `ink.key.*` change shows up there immediately.
- `inkhaven bund "ink.key.list"` (with `keymap` opted in) dumps the
  whole table as JSON. Use it to verify an overlay applied
  correctly, or to grep for "which chord runs X?"

## Hard-blocked chords

The following are intercepted before the chord dispatcher, so
they can't be overridden:

| Chord | Why |
|-------|-----|
| `Ctrl+Q` | Hard quit — the safety net |
| Whatever `meta_prefix` is set to (default `Ctrl+B`) | Setting yields prefix recursion |
| Whatever `bund_prefix` is set to (default `Ctrl+Z`) | Same |

You can change the prefix chords themselves via top-level
`keys.meta_prefix` / `keys.bund_prefix` in HJSON; that's not the
overlay channel, so the rule about "can't be in `bindings:`" still
applies.

## Examples

### Disable the typewriter chord

```hjson
keys: {
  bindings: [
    { chord: "Ctrl+b w", action: "none" }
  ]
}
```

### Add a global "open credits on F12"

Not yet supported — `bindings` requires the `<prefix> <suffix>`
two-token form. Direct chord rebinding (single-key) lands in a
later phase.

### Save-time lint via Bund

```hjson
scripting: {
  enabled_categories: ["keymap"]
  bootstrap: '''
    "hook.on_save" {
      drop
      "(saved)" println
    } register
    "Ctrl+b j" { "jot!" println } ink.key.bind_lambda
  '''
}
```

After project open: every save prints `(saved)` to the TUI log;
`Ctrl+B J` runs the inline lambda and prints `jot!`.

## Failure modes

- **Unknown action**: parse error at startup with line context.
  Inkhaven refuses to launch with a malformed `bindings:`.
- **Prefix mismatch**: an overlay entry whose first token isn't
  `meta_prefix` or `bund_prefix` errors at startup.
- **Suffix == prefix**: rejected — would cause infinite recursion.
- **Bund-side bind without `keymap` enabled**: the `ink.key.*` word
  runs the deny-stub from the sandbox; you'll see "script denied
  by inkhaven policy" in your status bar / log.

## 1.2.5 + 1.2.6 — new actions

Every named action introduced between the original document
and the 1.2.6 release. Use these in your `keys.bindings`
overlay.

### Tag actions (1.2.5+)

| Action | Default chord | What it does |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| `global.tag_paragraph` | `Ctrl+B ]` | Open the tag picker on the open paragraph. |
| `global.tag_search` | `Ctrl+B }` | Open the project-wide tag-search picker. |

(The tree-pane `g` chord for the picker is hard-coded
because it shares the multi-select space with the
existing tree pickers; not user-rebindable.)

### View actions (1.2.5–1.2.6)

| Action | Default chord | What it does |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| `view.story_graph` | `Ctrl+V Shift+W` | Book story view (radial PNG). |
| `view.story_graph_paragraph` | `Ctrl+V w` | Paragraph mini story view (1.2.6+). |
| `view.next_diagnostic` | `Ctrl+V N` | Jump to next typst diagnostic. |
| `view.event_picker` | `Ctrl+V e` | (1.2.6+) Open the event picker. Requires `timeline.enabled`. |
| `view.new_event_prompt` | `Ctrl+V Shift+E` | (1.2.6+) Open the timeline view AND immediately fire the new-event title prompt — works from any pane, no need to first add an event from the CLI. Requires `timeline.enabled`. |
| `view.timeline` | `Ctrl+V Shift+T` | (1.2.6+) Open the swim-lane timeline view. Requires `timeline.enabled`. Lowercase `Ctrl+V t` is the per-paragraph word-count target. |
| `view.edit_event_metadata` | `Ctrl+V Shift+I` | (1.2.6+) Edit the open event paragraph's `start | end | track` in a one-line pipe-separated prompt. Precision is re-derived from the start string on commit. No-op when the open paragraph isn't an event. |

### Diagnostic actions (1.2.6+)

| Action | Default chord | What it does |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| `editor.diagnostics_list` | `F8` | Open the floating diagnostics list modal. |
| `editor.explain_diagnostic` | `Ctrl+F12` | Send the diagnostic at cursor + ±5 context lines to AI. Was `F11`; macOS grabs F11 globally, so the chord moved. Linux + Windows users can bind F11 back via `keys.bindings`. |
| `editor.critique` | `F12` | AI critique (mode-aware: critique-edit / critique-changes). |

### Rebinding F11 back to explain (Linux + Windows)

```hjson
keys: {
  bindings: [
    { chord: "F11", action: "editor.explain_diagnostic" }
  ]
}
```

The existing `Ctrl+F12` binding stays — both fire the
action. Multiple bindings → multiple working chords.

### Snapshot annotation chord (1.2.6+)

`F5` continues to bind `editor.create_snapshot`. The
chord's *behaviour* changed (annotation prompt now pops
first) but the binding is the same — no overlay change
needed.

### macOS-specific caveats

macOS reserves several function keys system-wide:

| Key | macOS owner |
|-----|-------------|
| F11 | Show Desktop (Mission Control) |
| F12 | Dashboard (deprecated; sometimes still active) |
| Ctrl+Up / Down / Left / Right | Mission Control gestures |
| Cmd+Tab / Cmd+Q | System app switcher / quit |

Inkhaven's `Ctrl+F12` works on macOS because the
Ctrl-modifier shifts the chord out of Apple's owned
range. `Cmd+anything` doesn't bind in the TUI — macOS
doesn't pass those events to terminal apps.
